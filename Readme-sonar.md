Sonar analysis:

Excluded from coverage: all .test.js files <br>
Excluded from security hotspots: all .test.js files <br>
Excluded from analysis: all node modules, package.json, package-lock.json and yml files


For backend, achieved coverage is near 80% and this is the most important part, since frontend test
are more visual rather than automatic.

With fronted tests we have achieved less coverage, and this obviously let the global coverage fall down.
